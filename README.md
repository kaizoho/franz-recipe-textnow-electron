## franz-recipe-textnow-electron
TextNow Electron recipe for Franz 5.

### TextNow Electron?
Yes. https://electron.textnow.com is used in TextNow's official UWP and macOS apps.

### Known Issue
Ads still display. My current solution is to use [SwitchHosts](https://github.com/oldj/SwitchHosts) in combination with [the MVPS host file](https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt). Test and working on Windows 10 20H2 and Ubuntu 20.04.
